    "descriptionTwo": "Lets start with the layout. There is NO CSS framework. I used flex display to get the responsiveness. I also made use of CSS variables to define common use cases. Using VueJS allowed me create re-usable components like the modal which I use for my contact form and random quotes. The buttons are also a component that accepts props to give you flexibility to re-use then as you wish. I did a similar thing with the images by creating an image component which accepted different images as props. I use VUEX to handle the state which takes care of all my HTTP requests, loading animation.",
